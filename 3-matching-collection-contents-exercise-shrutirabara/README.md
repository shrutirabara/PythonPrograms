# Matching-collection-contents-exercise

- Create a Python module that will determine if two collections
have the same contents The Module should:
  - Handle two collections of any type
  - Have a function to determining if the collections have the
exact same contents (regardless of type)
  - Have a function to determining if the two collections have
the same unique contents, but can be of different lengths

**Examples:**
{1, 3, 5, 0} == {0, 5, 1, 3} ... okay
{ 3, 5, 4, 0} == {0, 5, 1, 3} ... FAIL
